Our firm specializes in doing law type things. We are pretty good at it too. We can probably help you out, unless you are trying to sue your employer for mandating vaccinations. If that's the case, you are better off just letting us smack you in the head, then writing us a check for a few thousand dollars as payment for saving you the time and embarrasment of trying to convince anyone that you aren't insane.
