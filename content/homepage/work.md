Our highly experienced Labor and Employment Law attorneys advise and represent California employees and employers from all industries in a variety of employment-related matters, including wage and hour class actions, harassment, discrimination, and wrongful termination, independent contractor misclassification, unfair labor practices, and administrative proceedings. For employees, we take cases on a contingency fee, meaning you only pay if we win your case.
